Welcome to The Royal Family website! This post demonstrates how easy it is to create and publish new content using our Jekyll-powered system.

## What Makes This Easy?

Gone are the days of editing HTML files directly. Now you can focus on what matters most: creating great content about Kansas City sports.

### Simple Markdown Writing

Instead of complicated HTML tags, you write in simple Markdown:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle highlights  
- Headers that automatically format
- Lists that just work
- [Links](/) that are easy to create

### Automatic Features

When you publish a post, several things happen automatically:

1. **SEO optimization** - meta tags, descriptions, and social sharing
2. **Category organization** - posts appear in the right sections
3. **RSS feed updates** - subscribers get notified
4. **Sitemap generation** - search engines can find your content
5. **Responsive design** - looks great on all devices

## The Publishing Workflow

Here's how simple it is to publish new content:

### Step 1: Create Your File
Create a new file in the `_posts/` directory with this naming format:
```
2025-01-11-how-to-create-content.md
```

### Step 2: Add Front Matter
Start your file with basic information:
```yaml

layout: post
title: "Your Article Title"
date: 2025-01-11 16:00:00 -0600

```

### Step 3: Write Your Content
Then just write your article in plain text with simple Markdown formatting.

### Step 4: Publish
Commit your file and push to GitHub. The site rebuilds automatically!
